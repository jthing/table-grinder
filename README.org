* Table-Grinder 

This is a proof of concept that you can grind a common lisp and web interface directly from a database table.

+ CLOS Class interface using the postmodern dau-class interface
+ HTML Table listing the records in a table
+ HTML Form for entering and editing table entries

Basically CRUD without the cruft..

** Installation

Before You can use this library you need to install postgresql.
On Ubuntu that would be:

- sudo apt install postgresql.
- sudo -u postgres psql template1
- ALTER USER postgres with encrypted password 'your_password';
- ADD USER 'your name' with encrypted password 'your_password';
- CREATED DATABASE 'your_name' with owner='your_name';

From the command line you can now write plain psql.
This will log you inn as your username into the database with your name.
Then you need to setup the program.
  
- Open file <install-dir>/src/test-postmodern.lisp
  From REPL:
  - (asdf:system-source-directory (asdf:find-system "table-grinder"))
  Returns the directory where the source is installed.
- Start Slime/Sly.
- Change the entries *default-database* and *default-user* to your user.
- Open file main.lisp and press C-c ~
- From sly:
  - # (pw:start-testing)
  - # (make-sample-database)
- In the browser open localhost:4242

When you are finished type (pw:stop-testing)
